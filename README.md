ixxus-endless-scroll
====================

Endless scroll
This is a POC DocumentViewRenderer that will allow "endless scroll" functionality in Alfresco Share
Allowing users to fetch more data by scrolling to the end of a page such as the functionality of the twitter website

The POM uses an internal ixxus dependency that resolves the share sdk, ths can be replaced by the correct Alfresco dependencies to build
