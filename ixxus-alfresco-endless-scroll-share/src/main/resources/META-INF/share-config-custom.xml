         <!-- The view renderers that will be available as options in DocumentLibrary, My Files, Shared Files and 
              Repository pages. This list can be added to or removed to control the views displayed. Use the a module
              that provides evaluated configuration to have the options change based on criteria (e.g. site name, 
              site preset, user group, etc)
              
              Remember to include all dependencies, even those duplicated by another view - Surf will ensure only 
              one version of each is loaded - but if a view is removed that depends on a dependency defined in another
              view then it will cause an error.
